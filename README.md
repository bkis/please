# please
A very polite companion that helps remembering terminal one-liners :woman_technologist:

## What is this?
_please_ is a **bash script**. Just one file, very simple. It takes only a handful of arguments. But, more importantly ...

## What does it do? How to use it?
...

## Why would I ever use this instead of just creating aliases by hand?
Well, first of all, no one forces you to use it, so sit back down and try to breathe steadily. Here are a few possible answers:

-   Not everyone is a natural pro-hacker-6000â„¢ and some don't even want to become one. For some people adding aliases in `.bashrc` (or similar) wouldn't be the most obvious workflow. Instead, whenever the occasional terminal user might **struggle to remember this almighty one-liner** they found online five years ago to resize 20469 holiday photos in one go, they can **just type** `please look for "crop image"` (the quotes are actually optional) to get a list of their relevant noted one-liners.
-   It's **fun** to use a command line tool with such a _**natural, friendly syntax**_ for a change. It really is!
-   This is _**not**_ for managing your everyday commands! Obviously, this tool is not really useful for remembering `ls -lah` or the like. You'll want to create an alias for this, I understand. But what about `ffmpeg -i "$video-file" -vcodec copy -af "volume=12dB" "Optimized_$video-file"`, which raises the audio volume of a video file by 12dB while not touching the video signal? Will you use that daily? Will you remember it after some weeks? :thinking: No, you'll start searching the internet for it.
-   Go ahead, collect your hundreds of aliases in your `.bashrc` over the years. An then when you need one of them, of course you won't remember it, forcing you to search your aliases.
-   It has colors :open_mouth: The colors and the font styling make it very readable (and cool), you know?
